linecast {version} — weather, sunlight, the moon, the sky, tides, radar, and maps for the terminal

  linecast weather     Conditions now, the day's temperature curve, the forecast, and alerts
  linecast sunshine    The sun's arc across the sky, dawn to dusk, or the whole year
  linecast moon        The moon as it looks tonight, its rise and set, and a month calendar
  linecast sky         The stars, planets, and Milky Way over you, as you would see them
  linecast orrery      An offline heliocentric solar-system instrument and observer sky
  linecast tides       Tide chart from the nearest station, or a global model where there is none
  linecast radar       Weather radar over a map, the last hour and the next
  linecast maps        Street maps, hillshaded terrain, and routes

Settings (run alone to show, give a value to set):
  linecast location    A fixed place, instead of the one your IP address suggests
  linecast language    en, fr, es, de, it, pt, nl, pl, no, sv, is, da, fi, ja, ko, zh, th, id,
                       uk, or vi
  linecast units       metric or imperial
  linecast clock       12-hour or 24-hour
  linecast week        The day the moon calendar's week opens on: monday, sunday, or saturday
  linecast icons       nerd, emoji, or plain
  linecast calendar    Which calendar the moon follows: chinese, japanese, korean, vietnamese, thai,
                       hawaiian, samoan, chamorro, refaluwasch, islamic, hebrew, almanac, or none
  linecast culture     Whose constellations the sky draws: chinese, hawaiian, norse, maori,
                       boorong, and seventeen more, or none for the IAU sky
  For one run, a flag: --location "Québec" or 41.88,-87.63, --lang fr, --imperial, --24h

Housekeeping:
  linecast link        Make weather, moon, … short commands beside linecast
  linecast doctor      Where files live, what the terminal supports, which providers answer
  linecast completion  Shell completion script for bash, zsh, fish, or nushell

Run any command with --help for options.
