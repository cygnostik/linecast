"""Live mode: alternate screen rendering with auto-refresh and input handling.

Provides the live_loop() function that runs a render callback in a loop on the
terminal's alternate screen buffer, LiveApp — the class an app with keys and
state subclasses to run under it — and overlay(), which puts a tooltip, modal
or panel over a frame.  The loop supports:

- Auto-refresh on a configurable interval
- Immediate re-render on terminal resize
- Frames paced to the terminal: the next waits until the last was read
- Re-inking in place when the terminal's colour theme changes
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, q to quit, n to reset)
- Mouse wheel scrubbing (SGR and legacy X10/VT200 encoding)
- Alert modal interaction (click to open, scroll to read, q/click to dismiss)

Mouse protocol references:
  - SGR (1006): https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Extended-coordinates

               or just display_string.
               If mouse=True, also receives mouse_pos=(col, row) or None
               and active_alert=int_or_None.
               Scroll/arrow keys adjust offset_minutes to scrub through time.
    interval: seconds between refreshes.
    mouse: if True, enable SGR mouse tracking and pass mouse_pos to render_fn.
    on_open: optional callback(alert_index) called when user presses 'o' on a modal.
    scroll_step: minutes to advance/retreat per scroll or arrow key event.
    auto_play: if True, run an animation loop instead of time-scrubbing.
               render_fn also receives play_frame (monotonic frame counter) and
               playing (bool). Space toggles play/pause — pausing homes
               play_frame to 0 (the caller's "home" frame, e.g. the present);
               scroll/arrows step one frame and pause in place; play_interval
               sets the frame rate.
    on_action: optional callback(key) for miscellaneous single-character keys
               not otherwise handled ('+', '-', 'c', 'w', …). Return a truthy
               value to trigger an immediate re-render; return falsy to leave
               the loop waiting as before. Default None preserves existing
               behavior exactly.
    on_drag: optional callback(dcol, drow, done) for left-button drags.
             Fired with the cumulative cell delta from the press position:
             during the drag with done=False (live preview) and once on
             release with done=True (commit). Return a truthy value to
             trigger an immediate re-render. Requires mouse. Default None
             preserves existing behavior exactly.
    play_gate: optional callable() consulted before each auto-play frame
               advance. Return falsy to hold the animation on the current
               frame (the loop still re-renders every play_interval, so the
               caller can animate a buffering indicator); return truthy to
               let playback proceed. Only consulted while auto_play is on
               and playing. Default None preserves existing behavior.
    intercept: optional callback(action) consulted for every decoded keyboard
               action ('fwd', 'quit', 'key:t', …; mouse events excluded)
               BEFORE the built-in handling. Return truthy to consume the
               action and trigger a re-render — this is how a caller-drawn
               menu takes over the arrow keys. Default None preserves
               existing behavior exactly.
    on_wheel: optional callback(direction, col, row) for mouse wheel
              events: +1 up / -1 down, and the pointer's 1-based terminal
              (col, row) — the same frame as mouse_pos — so the caller
              can zoom about the pointer rather than the view centre.
              When set it takes the wheel over entirely (no time-scrub,
              no frame-step, no modal scroll — the caller decides, e.g.
              zoom vs panel scroll). Return truthy to re-render; falsy
              leaves the frame alone (a clamped zoom).
              Default None preserves existing behavior exactly.
    text_mode: optional callable() -> bool consulted before each key read.
               While truthy, printable input arrives at intercept as
               'char:<c>' plus 'key:backspace'/'key:kill'/'key:enter' —
               the plumbing for a caller-drawn text field. Escape
               sequences (arrows, mouse) decode as usual. Default None
               preserves existing behavior exactly.
    on_click: optional callback(col, row) for a left click — a press
              and release on the same cell, in the same 1-based frame
              as mouse_pos. Fired on the release, before the zero-delta
              on_drag commit, so a drag is never also a click. Return
              truthy to re-render. Requires mouse and on_drag (the
              press is only tracked while a drag callback is set).
              Default None preserves existing behavior exactly.
    help_panel: optional _help.HelpPanel for the view's controls. It owns
                `?` and input while open, without changing the view's state.
                Text fields still receive a literal question mark.
    Re-renders immediately on terminal resize or input.

    While idle, re-probes the terminal's colours now and then (see
    _theme.poll_interval / watch_path) and repaints when they change,
    so switching the terminal theme re-inks the view in place.

    live_loop's keyword hooks are methods here, with the same contracts

    hold exactly as they do for a bare render callback: without
    on_wheel the wheel scrubs time, without on_drag the press is not
    tracked and there are no clicks.  `run()` puts the app on screen
    and calls `stop()` on the way out, however the loop ends.
